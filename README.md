# Jam Game for Wowie Jam 4.0
Wowie! It has been a long time since I participated in a game jam. The last one was 7DRL in 2020? I hope I can have fun this time.

I will be pretty busy this weekend, so I'm only planning to spend 2-3 hours jamming. This is pretty restricted, but I gotta start somewhere.

The Jam will start overnight, but I spent a little time today thinking about what mechanics I might want to include or build the game around. These are super simple, which will hopefully help me keep scope down.

## mechanics ideas
- dodging obstacles for high score
- collect or hit objects for high score
- jump up or down platforms infinitely
- gravity switch flappy bird
- click to jump
- roguelike dungeon (scope too large)
- shoot in a circle
- click to break, click to collect
- object is too heavy, player momentum
- infection game, x clicks or player to infect a group

# THEME: Collaborate with AI!
Idea: Vampire Survivors Style w/ Companion

Needs:
- player that shoots projectiles
- companion that shoots projectiles (controlled by AI)
- enemies that spawn and pursue the player and companion
- projectiles kill enemies and add score for player + companion
- enemies kill player, end the game
- high score is stored
- sound effects
- screenshake

Stretch: 
- fancy effects
- more music + sound effects
- varied enemies (with projectiles?)
- player progression (new projectiles/speed as score goes up?)
- enemy progression (increased spawn rates or speed as score goes up?)
- optional randomization of player/companion/enemy/world/projectile sprites
